#Installation Guide and Project Creation Steps

## To Install NODE
1. Check if node is already in your machine. Go to cmd and type node -v. If version like v12.34.5 appears then no need to install node.
2. To install node head to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the installer for your OS.
3. Once the installer finishes downloading, launch it. Open the downloads link in your browser and click the file. Or, browse to the location where you have saved the file and double-click it to launch.
4. The system will ask if you want to run the software – click Run.
5. You will be welcomed to the Node.js Setup Wizard – click Next.
6. On the next screen, review the license agreement. Click Next if you agree to the terms and install the software.
7. The installer will prompt you for the installation location. Leave the default location, unless you have a specific need to install it somewhere else – then click Next.
8. The wizard will let you select components to include or remove from the installation. Again, unless you have a specific need, accept the defaults by clicking Next.
9. Finally, click the Install button to run the installer. When it finishes, click Finish.
